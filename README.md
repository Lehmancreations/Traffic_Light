# Traffic_Light
Turn an old traffic light into a smart traffic light.

We are using a NodeMCU and a 4 channel relay to control this. This repo will be updated as more information comes available. 

We have a proof of concept code written that will allow you to change the lights by hitting an API on the IP address of the NodeMCU
however if we run a sequence it is blocking and we cant don anything else till it finishes. 

## Stay tuned for more information and demos
